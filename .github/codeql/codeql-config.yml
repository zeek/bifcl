name: "bifcl CodeQL config"

# CodeQL is bizarre -- "paths-ignore" only works for select languages, not
# including C/C++. Removing the build tree after the build doesn't work either
# because the build process itself contributes CodeQL data. You also cannot
# express alert management in-code. So ... all that's left is crude filter
# management below and battling the UI.
